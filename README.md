This program is a game that randomly picks two celebrities from a list, then asks the player
who they believe has the highest follower count on Instagram between the two of them.

If the player guesses right, then the game continues. If the player guesses wrong then 
the game ends and the final score is displayed.

The data is imported from game_data.py into celebrity_versus.py, which then pulls the 
information about each celebrity (name, follower count, description of what makes them famous,
and what country their from), stores it into variables, and displays it to the player so they
can make their choice.
